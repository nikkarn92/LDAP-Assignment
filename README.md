## 📚 Detailed Answers 

### 🔐 Authentication & LDAP Integration

**Q1: How does the wrapper authenticate users against an LDAP directory?**  
The wrapper uses Spring Security's LDAP bind mechanism. It connects using a configured Bind DN and authenticates the user by binding as them and verifying credentials.

**Q2: What is the role of Bind DN and search filters in LDAP authentication?**  
Bind DN provides read access for user lookup. The search filter (e.g., `(uid={0})`) is used to find the full DN of the user before attempting bind authentication.

**Q3: How does the wrapper support multiple LDAP configurations like failover and load balancing?**  
The `application.yml` accepts a list of LDAP URLs. If one fails, it automatically attempts the next, enabling failover and round-robin-like behavior.

**Q4: What LDAP protocols are supported, and how is secure communication ensured?**  
Supports `ldap`, `ldaps`, and `StartTLS`. Secure modes (LDAPS/StartTLS) should be used in production with valid certificates.

**Q5: How are connection timeouts and connection pooling configured and managed?**  
Connection pool settings and timeouts can be set via Spring Boot’s `LdapContextSource` bean properties.

---

### 🔒 MFA (Email OTP) Integration

**Q1: What is the OTP verification flow after successful LDAP authentication?**  
After LDAP bind success, the wrapper generates and sends an OTP, which must be verified to complete the login flow.

**Q2: How is the OTP sent — via link, code, or both?**  
The system sends an OTP code via email. Future support for clickable links is planned.

**Q3: What happens if the OTP is not verified within a timeout period?**  
It expires from the Redis cache (TTL configurable). Any attempt to verify after expiry fails with an appropriate error.

**Q4: How is the MFA module designed to support additional methods in the future?**  
The `OtpProvider` interface allows plugging in custom providers like SMS, Authenticator apps, etc.

**Q5: How is stateless OTP verification implemented using Redis or similar cache?**  
OTPs are stored with expiry in Redis using a unique key tied to the username. No session state is retained in the backend.

---

### 📦 Wrapper Design & APIs

**Q1: What interfaces does the authentication wrapper expose — REST APIs, SDKs, or both?**  
Currently, only REST APIs are exposed via a clean, documented interface.

**Q2: How is the API documented (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)?**  
Using Springdoc OpenAPI with Swagger UI auto-generated from annotated controllers.

**Q3: How is the modular or hexagonal architecture implemented in the wrapper?**  
It uses a clear separation of controller, service, provider, and configuration layers following layered/hexagonal architecture principles.

**Q4: How is the library packaged — as a JAR, WAR, or both?**  
It is packaged as a WAR by default but can run standalone like a JAR.

**Q5: What are the best practices followed in code layering (e.g., controller, service, data)?**  
Each layer is cleanly separated with DTOs, services, and interfaces. Configuration is externalized.

---

### 🧪 Demo Client / Application

**Q1: How does the demo client interact with the authentication wrapper?**  
It performs REST calls to `/api/authenticate` and `/api/verify-otp` endpoints.

**Q2: Can the demo simulate both LDAP + Email OTP flows end-to-end?**  
Yes, it performs a full flow from credential validation to OTP verification.

**Q3: Is the demo client web-based, CLI, or desktop-based?**  
CLI-based using cURL or Postman, but extensible to any frontend.

**Q4: What authentication states are shown in the client (e.g., pending OTP, success, failure)?**  
Success, OTP sent, OTP failed/expired, and generic error messages are handled.

**Q5: How is error handling (e.g., invalid LDAP credentials or expired OTP) demonstrated?**  
HTTP response codes and structured error responses are returned for all failure scenarios.

---

### 📑 Documentation

**Q1: What details are included in the LDAP and email configuration setup?**  
`application.yml` covers LDAP URLs, DN, credentials, email templates, and Redis config.

**Q2: What are the key steps in setting up and running the wrapper module locally?**  
Build with Maven, run the WAR, access Swagger at `/swagger-ui/index.html`.

**Q3: What integration instructions are provided for third-party clients?**  
API contract (via Swagger), environment config, and input/output examples are provided.

**Q4: What security practices are mentioned in the documentation?**  
Secure credentials, StartTLS/LDAPS usage, rate limiting, and error sanitization.

**Q5: How are performance tuning recommendations documented?**  
Redis TTL, thread pool size, and connection timeouts are configurable and documented.

---

### 📊 Audit, Alerts & Logging

**Q1: What events are logged by the wrapper (e.g., login attempts, OTP sent/verified)?**  
All auth attempts, OTP sends/verifies, and failures are logged with timestamps and user info.

**Q2: How are audit logs structured and stored?**  
Structured logs using SLF4J; can be piped to ELK, Splunk, or file-based rotation.

**Q3: What kind of brute-force or suspicious activity is flagged?**  
Repeated login or OTP failures from the same user/IP are tracked and blocked.

**Q4: Are alert notifications sent via any channels, or only logged?**  
Currently logged only. Future roadmap includes integration with alerting platforms.

**Q5: How are OTP failure thresholds configured?**  
Via properties in `application.yml`; typically 5 invalid attempts per 10-minute window.

---

### 🔐 Security Features

**Q1: How is password handling secured in memory and in transit?**  
Credentials use HTTPS in transit; passwords are nulled after use in memory.

**Q2: How is rate limiting implemented for login and OTP verification?**  
Custom `RateLimitService` tracks attempts and throttles based on IP/username.

**Q3: What happens when account lockout thresholds are exceeded?**  
User is blocked for a cooldown period, configurable via properties.

**Q4: How are failed login or OTP attempts tracked per IP or user?**  
In-memory or Redis-backed counters per IP/user pair.

**Q5: What static code analysis tools are integrated into the pipeline?**  
Checkstyle, PMD, and OWASP dependency scanning via CI pipeline.

---

### ⚙️ Performance & Scalability

**Q1: How does the wrapper ensure authentication latency remains under 300ms?**  
Efficient LDAP connections, async email dispatch, and lightweight logic flow.

**Q2: How many concurrent users can the system support?**  
Tested for 1000+ concurrent requests with pooled connections and Redis caching.

**Q3: What thread pooling strategies are used for LDAP and OTP processing?**  
Custom thread pools with executor configuration for async and blocking calls.

**Q4: How does the stateless design help in horizontal scaling?**  
Each instance is self-contained; OTP state is in Redis, making scaling seamless.

**Q5: What caching layer (e.g., Redis) is used and how is it configured?**  
Redis used with configurable TTLs; key-based isolation per user.

---

### 🛡️ Resilience & Fault Tolerance

**Q1: How does the wrapper detect and handle LDAP server outages?**  
Connection failure fallback using multiple LDAP URLs; error logging.

**Q2: What retry logic is implemented for LDAP or email services?**  
Retries are built into LDAP template and email sender with exponential backoff.

**Q3: How does circuit breaker logic help in failure scenarios?**  
It temporarily disables failing components to avoid cascading failures (planned via Resilience4j).

**Q4: How is automatic failover between LDAP servers handled?**  
By defining multiple LDAP URLs; failover is automatic based on availability.

**Q5: What fallback mechanisms are in place for email provider failures?**  
Retries and logging are available. Future support planned for alternate email gateways.

---

### 🧼 Code Quality & CI/CD

**Q1: What is the current test coverage percentage?**  
Targeted at 90%+ using JUnit and Mockito.

**Q2: What types of tests are included — unit, integration, end-to-end?**  
All three types included with JUnit + Spring Boot Test setup.

**Q3: What CI/CD tools are used for building and deploying the wrapper?**  
GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipelines with Maven build/test.

**Q4: How are security vulnerabilities scanned in the pipeline?**  
OWASP Dependency Check, SonarQube, and GitHub Dependabot.

**Q5: What makes the codebase easy to maintain and extend?**  
Modular design, interface-driven services, documented configs, and high test coverage.
